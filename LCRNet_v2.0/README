# LCR-Net release v2.0

This contains the code based on pytorch deep learning framework  for testing our model proposed in the CVPR'17 paper:
LCR-Net: Localization-Classification-Regression for Human Pose.
We only provide code for testing our models, not for training.
The code has been tested on Linux with Cuda 9.x and Cudnn 7.x. We do not provide support for other OS or configuration.
Please note that our code is released only for scientific or personal use under the GNU General Public License.

### Preparation

* Download and install Detectron.pytorch: https://github.com/roytseng-tw/Detectron.pytorch (we do not provide support for its installation)
* Create a symbolic link in this folder to Detectron.pytorch

### Usage 

To use our code on an image, use the following command:

python demo.py <modelname> <imagename> <gpuid>

* <modelname>: name of model to use (see our website for the list of available models)
* <imagename>: name of the image to test
* <gpuid>: gpu id to use (-1 for cpu)

### History

* September 2018 (release v2.0)
  * test code in pytorch with ResNet backbone
* August 2018 (release v1.1)
  * bug fix in lcr_net_ppi
  * show the 3d scene instead of individual 3d pose
* March 2018: release of new models trained on additional synthetic data
* July 2017   (release v1.0)
